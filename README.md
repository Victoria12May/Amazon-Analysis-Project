## Dataset Overview: Amazon Product Review Analysis
The dataset in question is a collection of product and customer review data scraped from Amazon product pages. This data is intended to assist in generating insights for product improvement, marketing strategies, and understanding customer engagement for sellers on platforms like Amazon.

1. Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed information on products and customer reviews, which are stored in rows, where each row represents a unique product. The columns are populated with various attributes that describe each product's features, customer engagement, and other important metrics.

 ## Dirty Dataset
This dataset is considered "dirty" due to the presence of inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicate entries. These issues can distort the accuracy of analysis and machine learning models. Duplicates, for example, may lead to overrepresented data, while missing values could result in biased outcomes. Data cleaning is necessary to identify and correct these issues, ensuring the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for meaningful analysis or model training.

## Cleaning the Dataset and Removing Duplicates
Data cleaning is a crucial part of data preprocessing in any data analysis or machine learning workflow. One of the common issues encountered during this phase is the presence of duplicate entries within the dataset. Duplicates can skew analysis, distort results, and lead to inaccurate conclusions, so it is important to identify and remove them.
